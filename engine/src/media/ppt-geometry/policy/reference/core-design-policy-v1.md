# Branch Presentation Core Design Policy

Policy-Version: 1.0.0
Policy-Rules: core-design-policy-v1.rules.json

This policy is the stable design authority for every governed Branch PPT workflow. Category guides add scenario-specific guidance but cannot weaken these rules. The exact user request and supplied source material remain the content authority.

## 1. Evidence and source integrity

- Never invent facts, metrics, citations, customer examples, research results, or source URLs.
- Label missing evidence as a placeholder, assumption, or item to be supplied.
- Put the source, date or period, units, and measurement basis beside external facts and charts.
- Preserve the meaning of user-supplied evidence. Visual polish must never change or conceal it.

These evidence rules cannot be overridden by a style request.

## 2. Reader task and page strategy

- Give every slide one primary reader task and one primary judgment, question, or action.
- Build a narrative with deliberate pacing. Do not add a table of contents, divider, or closing page unless it serves the reader.
- Prefer a diagram, chart, table, or direct comparison when it explains a relationship more clearly than prose.
- Keep ordinary slides scannable. Split material before shrinking it into unreadable text.

## 3. Typography

- Declare display and body font roles; add a monospace role only when the subject needs code or identifiers.
- Use at most two non-monospace families unless the user's exact source establishes a brand system that requires more.
- Declare a numeric type scale with distinct title, section, body, and caption levels.
- Keep body and caption text readable at presentation distance. Do not use tiny text to rescue an overloaded slide.
- Use weight, size, alignment, whitespace, and thin rules before adding containers.

## 4. Color

- Declare stable semantic roles for background, foreground, accent, muted, and status colors.
- Declare the background treatment as solid, gradient, or image. Gradient color stops must be explicit.
- Use one structural palette throughout the deck; color must communicate meaning rather than decorate empty space.
- Maintain readable contrast for text, charts, and annotations. The declared foreground/background pair and the foreground against every gradient stop must meet WCAG AA contrast of at least 4.5:1.
- User brand colors take priority only when supported by the exact request or supplied materials.

## 5. Layout and spacing

- Declare a spacing unit, page margins, column count, and gutter before composing slides.
- Use stable title and content axes across related pages while varying rhythm according to content.
- Prefer direct placement, whitespace, alignment, and thin separators over nested panels.
- Keep diagrams, charts, tables, screenshots, and text editable whenever the PPTD format supports it.
- Never stretch raster assets; crop or contain them while preserving aspect ratio.

## 6. Imagery and charts

- Use user-provided imagery first when it is relevant and usable.
- Add imagery only when it advances the reader task; do not add decorative pictures to fill space.
- Keep imagery style and treatment consistent across the deck.
- Choose chart forms from the relationship in the data, remove default decoration, and label key values directly.

## 7. Default anti-patterns

The following patterns are forbidden by default:

- cards or rounded rectangles used merely to manufacture hierarchy or alignment;
- formulaic equal-width card grids when the content does not express equal peers;
- blue-purple gradients, cyan-purple neon, rainbow palettes, glowing borders, glassmorphism, particles, or ornamental grid effects used as generic "technology" styling;
- mixed icon systems, emoji as interface decoration, generic shadows, and gratuitous corner radii;
- full-slide raster flattening of editable text, charts, tables, or ordinary layout geometry;
- unsourced data, fabricated evidence, or citations that do not point to the claimed source.

A governed design plan may claim a visual anti-pattern exception only when it quotes exact supporting text from the source request. Evidence integrity and editable-deliverable rules never accept exceptions.

The companion rules file is the executable form of the numeric contrast threshold, restricted gradient color families, and restricted visual effects. The Markdown file and companion rules file share one version and are cryptographically bound; neither is authoritative in isolation.

## 8. Delivery gate

Before review or export, the workflow must have read the category index and one supported category guide, then submitted a complete design plan. Review and export are valid only for the current plan fingerprint and the current policy version and hash.

---

Run a persistent Branch Agent Gateway on [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/branch). Choose a **1-Click** managed deployment, or a **VPS** install you administer yourself.

## Prerequisites

- Hostinger account ([signup](https://www.hostinger.com/branch))
- About 5-10 minutes

## Option A: 1-Click Branch Agent

Hostinger handles infrastructure, Docker, and automatic updates. Fastest path to a running instance.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase and launch">
    1. From the [Hostinger Branch Agent page](https://www.hostinger.com/branch), choose a Managed Branch Agent plan and complete checkout.

    <Note>
    During checkout you can select **Ready-to-Use AI** credits. These credits are pre-purchased and integrated instantly inside Branch Agent. You need no external accounts or API keys from other providers. You can start chatting right away. Alternatively, provide your own key from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, or xAI during setup.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a messaging channel">
    Choose one or more channels to connect:

    - **WhatsApp** -- scan the QR code shown in the setup wizard.
    - **Telegram** -- paste the bot token from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete installation">
    Click **Finish** to deploy the instance. Once ready, access the Branch Agent dashboard from **Branch Agent Overview** in hPanel.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Option B: Branch Agent on VPS

More control over the server. Hostinger deploys Branch Agent via Docker on your VPS. You manage it through the **Docker Manager** in hPanel.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase a VPS">
    1. From the [Hostinger Branch Agent page](https://www.hostinger.com/branch), choose a Branch Agent on VPS plan and complete checkout.

    <Note>
    You can select **Ready-to-Use AI** credits during checkout. These credits are pre-purchased and integrated instantly inside Branch Agent. You can start chatting without any external accounts or API keys from other providers.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Branch Agent">
    Once the VPS is provisioned, fill in the configuration fields:

    - **Gateway token** -- auto-generated. Save it for later use.
    - **WhatsApp number** -- your number with country code (optional).
    - **Telegram bot token** -- from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) (optional).
    - **API keys** -- only needed if you did not select Ready-to-Use AI credits during checkout.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Branch Agent">
    Click **Deploy**. Once running, open the Branch Agent dashboard from the hPanel by clicking on **Open**.
  </Step>

</Steps>

Logs, restarts, and updates run from the Docker Manager interface in hPanel. To update, press **Update** in Docker Manager to pull the latest image.

## Verify your setup

Send "Hi" to your assistant on the channel you connected. Branch Agent replies and walks you through initial preferences.

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard not loading** -- Wait a few minutes for the container to finish provisioning. Then read the Docker Manager logs in hPanel.

**Docker container keeps restarting** -- Open Docker Manager logs and look for configuration errors (missing tokens, invalid API keys).

**Telegram bot not responding** -- With DM pairing required, an unknown sender gets a short pairing code, not a reply. Approve it from the Branch Agent dashboard chat. You can also run `branch pairing approve telegram <CODE>` if you have shell access to the container. See [Pairing](/channels/pairing).

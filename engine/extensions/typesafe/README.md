# TypeSafe AI for Branch Agent

Official external plugin for typed decisions with hosted TypeSafe AI Jev models
or a local Kev System One server.
It provides Choice, Score, and Boolean judgments through Branch Agent's shared
decision-model API. Core supplies the provider-neutral `decision_evaluate` agent
tool when the agent has an effective `decisionModel` selection, subject to normal
tool policy and harness capabilities. No separate tool enablement is required.

Requires Branch Agent and plugin API **2026.9.6 or later**. Released Branch Agent
2026.9.5 does not include the decision API.

```sh
branch plugins install @branch/typesafe
```

The Seedbank install spec is `clawhub:@branch/typesafe`. First publication is
pending a supporting release. Enable the plugin, configure a protected TypeSafe credential, and select
`typesafe/jev-latest` as your agent's `decisionModel`. With that selection,
`decision_evaluate` sends supplied evidence to TypeSafe AI and incurs its normal
usage charges. Other providers route evidence according to their own configuration.

For local Kev, configure `plugins.entries.typesafe.config.baseUrl` with the
server's loopback origin, such as `http://127.0.0.1:8009`, omit `apiKey`, and select
`typesafe/kev-latest`. The plugin calls `/v1/systemone` without a hosted credential.
Start the server separately with your chosen checkpoint; the decision-model
selection labels requests and does not download or load a model.

for configuration, rubrics, and API semantics.
